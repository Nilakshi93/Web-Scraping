In this project, I developed a web scraping script to extract data from the Wikipedia page(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_Kingdom) 
listing the largest companies in the United Kingdom. 
Using Python and the BeautifulSoup library, I automated the process of gathering company names, revenue figures, and other relevant details from the website. 
The project involved cleaning and organizing the extracted data, which I then stored in a structured format for further analysis. This project demonstrates my ability to work
with web scraping tools and handle unstructured data. The extracted data could be used for various purposes, such as generating reports, performing market analysis, 
or integrating with data visualization tools like Power BI or Tableau.
